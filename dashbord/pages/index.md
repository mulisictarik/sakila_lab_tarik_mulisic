# 🎬 Sakila DVD Rental Analysis Dashboard

## Hello and Welcome!

This dashboard serves as the central hub for the **DVD Rental Data Analysis** project, a core requirement of the SQL lab. The purpose is to apply SQL and data analysis techniques to find valuable insights from our legacy **Sakila database** (DVD rental data).

The entire project focuses on migrating legacy SQLite data to **DuckDB** and presenting key findings as requested in the tasks.

### 📊 Project Goals & Content Overview

This report contains the following key components, which you can navigate to via the sidebar:

- **Task 1: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
  - Answers to specific questions on movie lengths, popular titles, rental rates, and top actors (e.g., longest movies, top 10 actors).
  - _Source:_ The Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb`) used for Python/Pandas/DuckDB analysis.
- **Task 2: Visual Insights (Graphs)**
  - Key visualizations, including a **bar chart** showing the top 5 customers by total spend and a **revenue breakdown** by film category.
- **Task 3: BI Report (Bonus)**
  - A full **interactive dashboard** where Task 1 and 2 findings are presented using Evidence tables and charts.
